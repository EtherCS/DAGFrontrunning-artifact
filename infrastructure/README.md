# About public infrastructure

Public infrastructure is not necessary for running our code. A local machine is enough. In our evaluation, we tried two different machines, and both of them work. These include:

- (1) a server running Ubuntu 22.04 and is equipped with 48 CPU cores, 128 GB of RAM, and 10 TB SSD;
- (2) a MackBook Pro 2020 (Intel Chip) with 8 CPU cores, 16 GB of RAM, and 500 GB SSD.
